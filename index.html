        Happy Birthday, Toxic! ‚ù§Ô∏è <br><br>

        Hey Toxic,<br><br>

        It‚Äôs your special day, and I want to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to me. 
        I know I can be difficult sometimes‚Äîstubborn, moody, and even a little childish. 
        I know I act like I don‚Äôt need you, that I‚Äôm fine on my own, but trust me, that‚Äôs not true at all. 
        The truth is, I can‚Äôt imagine my life without you. 
        You‚Äôve been there for me in ways no one else has, and I appreciate you more than I can ever put into words.<br><br>

        I need you to understand me, really understand me. 
        I know I don‚Äôt always say things the way I should. 
        Sometimes, I keep things inside when I should just tell you. 
        Other times, I act distant, not because I don‚Äôt care, 
        but because I don‚Äôt know how to express what‚Äôs going on in my head. 
        But no matter what, you are someone I never want to lose. 
        Even when I‚Äôm at my worst, even when I push you away, deep down, I always want you to stay.<br><br>

        You have no idea how much of a difference you make in my life. 
        Your presence, your words, your understanding‚Äîit all means so much to me. 
        You always know when something‚Äôs wrong, even when I try to hide it. 
        You listen, even when I don‚Äôt make sense. 
        You somehow manage to make me laugh, even on my worst days. 
        And that‚Äôs something not everyone can do.<br><br>

        I know I can be frustrating at times. 
        I get annoyed easily, I overthink, and I don‚Äôt always show how much I appreciate you. 
        But the truth is, I do. 
        I appreciate you more than I could ever say. 
        Every little thing you do, even the things you think I don‚Äôt notice, I do. 
        And they mean the world to me.<br><br>

        Toxic, you are not just someone I talk to‚Äîyou are my safe space. 
        With you, I don‚Äôt have to pretend. 
        I don‚Äôt have to be perfect or have everything figured out. 
        You accept me as I am, and that‚Äôs something I will always be grateful for. 
        I know I don‚Äôt always make things easy, but I need you to see through all of that. 
        I need you to know that, despite my moods and my childish ways, 
        I care about you more than anything.<br><br>

        On your birthday, I just want you to know that I‚Äôll always be here, no matter what. 
        Through every high and low, through every small fight or misunderstanding, nothing will ever change. 
        You‚Äôre stuck with me, whether you like it or not. <br><br>

        I hope this year brings you everything you deserve‚Äîhappiness, success, and all the good things in life. 
        I‚Äôll always be cheering for you, supporting you, and reminding you that you are capable of amazing things.<br><br>

        So, Happy Birthday, Toxic! I hope you have the best day ever, because if anyone deserves it, it‚Äôs you.<br><br>

         ~Surbhi
